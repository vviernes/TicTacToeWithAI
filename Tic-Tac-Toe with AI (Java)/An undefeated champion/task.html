<p>Congratulations, you've almost reached the finish line! To complete the task, it's now time to turn the AI into a strong opponent by adding a <code class="java">hard</code> difficulty level.</p>
<p>Unlike <code class="java">medium</code>, when the AI is playing at <code class="java">hard</code> level, it doesn't just look one move ahead to see an immediate win or prevent an immediate loss. At this level, it can look two moves ahead, three moves ahead, and even further. It can calculate all possible moves that might be played during the game, and choose the best one based on the assumption that its opponent will also play perfectly. So, it doesn't rely on the mistakes of its opponent and plays the game without fault from start to finish regardless of the opponent's skill!</p>
<p>The algorithm that implements this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">minimax</a>. It's a recursive brute force algorithm that maximizes the value of the AI's position and minimizes the worth of its opponent's. Minimax is not just for Tic-Tac-Toe. You can use it with any other game where two players make alternate moves, such as chess.</p>

<p>In this last stage, you need to implement the <code class="java">hard</code> difficulty level using the minimax algorithm. As a recursive algorithm, it can be tricky to think about, so you should try to look at different resources to find the one that works best for your understanding (which is an important skill to get good at as you progress in you software development career!). Consider the following as starting points:</p>

<p>You should also add a <code class="java">hard</code> parameter so that it's possible to play against this level.</p>
